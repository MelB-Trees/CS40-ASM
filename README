Acknowledgements: 

     Thanks to Mark, Noah, and TAs in lab and office hours! :D

Correctly implemented:

     Everything

Incorrectly implemented:

     Nothing as far as we can tell

Departures from Calling Conventions:


Print Module Implenentation:

     We implemented the print module following the
     recommended recursive model in the spec. 
    
Value Stack Implementation:

     We represented the calculator's value stack as an
     initialized space of 10000 words in .section stk
     using r4 as a stack pointer, seperately from the 
     callstack

Sections:

     .section init:     Initialized main and the jumptable
     .section stk:      Declares space for the call and 
                        value stacks    
     .section rodata:   Declares space for the jumptable
     .section text:     Implements the functions used by 
                        main and the jumptable

Time Spent:

        Analysis:        3 hours

        Writing ASM:     6 hours

        Debugging:       2 hours
